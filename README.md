# Snake Game using TypeScript

A simple Snake game to explore the **basics of TypeScript** and understand its advantages over plain JavaScript.

---

## Project Purpose

This project demonstrates:

- The usage of global variables (`snake`, `velocity`, `food`, etc.) in `main.ts` to build a working snake game.
- A more **TypeScript-idiomatic** approach in `improved.ts`, where:
  - A **typed game state object** is introduced.
  - The game logic becomes **pure**, **modular**, and **testable**.

This contrast allows you to appreciate the **type safety**, **structure**, and **scalability** that TypeScript offers.
